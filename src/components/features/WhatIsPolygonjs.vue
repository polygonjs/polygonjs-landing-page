		<h2>Polygonjs helps you create interactive 3D for the Web</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="">Interactive 3D is now everywhere.</span> It is used for
			<span class="bg-cyan-300 dark:bg-cyan-800">scientific visualisations</span>,
			<span class="bg-teal-300 dark:bg-teal-800">product showcases</span>,
			<span class="bg-purple-300 dark:bg-purple-800">video games</span>,
			<span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">digital twins</span>,
			<span class="bg-yellow-300 dark:bg-yellow-800">configurators</span> or
			<span class="bg-amber-300 dark:bg-amber-800">artworks</span>. And new use cases appear regularly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Those experiences are notoriously difficult to create, as they require knowledge in both 3D and well, web.
			Crafting one that's functional can already be a challenge, and
			<span class="bg-red-300 dark:bg-red-800"
				>making it beautiful and performant is a whole different game.</span
			>
			And we haven't even talked about the different specializations in 3D, like texture artists, modeller,
			riggers, animators, look dev, shader developer, etc. This can get complicated quickly.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">Polygonjs helps you simplify this process</span>
			by giving you tools that are integrated, easy to use, and extensible.
