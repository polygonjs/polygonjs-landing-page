		<h2>Polygonjs helps you create interactive 3D for the Web</h2>
		<p>
			<span class="bg-emerald-300 dark:bg-emerald-800">Interactive 3D is now everywhere on the Web</span>. It is
			used for scientific visualisation, product showcase, video games, digital twins, configurators or artworks.
			And new use cases appear regularly.
		</p>
		<p>
			3D for the web is notoriously difficult to create, as it requires knowledge of both 3D and well, web. And
			making something work is one thing, making it beautiful and performant on a range of device requires even
			stronger skills. And we haven't even talked about the varieties of crafts in 3D, like texture artists,
			modeller, riggers, animators, look dev, shader developer, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">Polygonjs helps you simplify this process</span>
			by giving you a suite of tools that's integrated, easy to use, and extensible.
