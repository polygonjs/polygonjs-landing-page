		<h2>Node-Based Workflow</h2>
		<p>
			In Polygonjs, you create
			<span class="bg-emerald-300 dark:bg-emerald-800">3D scenes by connecting nodes together.</span> Some nodes
			help you generate geometries, some create materials. Others add behaviors to the scene objects, while others
			handle user inputs. Each does one thing and does it well.
		</p>
		<p>
			This allows you to create your scene in a node-based workflow, where you can try ideas without impacting the
			rest of your scene.
		</p>
		<p>
			This makes experimenting risk-free, and results in 3D scenes that quicly get prettier and more pleasant at
			every step. And <span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">you get better at your craft, fast</span>.
