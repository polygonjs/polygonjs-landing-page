		<h2>Node-Based Workflow</h2>
		<p>
			In Polygonjs, you create
			<span class="bg-emerald-300 dark:bg-emerald-800">3D scenes by connecting nodes together.</span> Some nodes
			help you <span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">generate geometries</span>, others
			<span class="bg-yellow-300 dark:bg-yellow-700">create materials</span>,
			<span class="bg-amber-300 dark:bg-amber-800">add behaviors to the scene objects</span>, or
			<span class="bg-fuchsia-300 dark:bg-fuchsia-800">handle user inputs</span>. Each node does one thing and
			does it well.
		</p>
		<p>
			This allows you to create your scene in a non destructive workflow, where you can try ideas without
			impacting the rest of your scene.
		</p>
		<p>
			This makes experimenting risk-free, and results in 3D scenes that get prettier and more pleasant at every
			step. <span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">And you get better at your craft, fast</span>.
