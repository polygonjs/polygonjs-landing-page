		<h2>Let's be honest, 3D is just plain fun</h2>
		<p>
			Sometimes, you don't need a reason to create 3D. It's just fun.
			<span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">Physics are fun</span>.
			<span class="bg-fuchsia-300 dark:bg-fuchsia-800">Particles too</span>.
			<span class="bg-yellow-300 dark:bg-yellow-700">Creating gorgeous materials is really satisfying</span>.
			<span class="bg-amber-300 dark:bg-amber-800">Procedural modeling is empowering</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
			But I'm running out of positive adjectives, so why don't you relax and enjoy this little
			mini-exploration-game? Use <span class="bg-orange-300 dark:bg-orange-800">WASD keys to move</span>,
			<span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">Shift to run</span> and
			<span class="bg-teal-300 dark:bg-teal-800">Space to jump</span>.
