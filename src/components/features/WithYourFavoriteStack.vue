		<h2>Polygonjs works with your favorite tech stack</h2>
		<p>
			Polygonjs is framework-agnostic. It only needs javascript to run. This means you can integrate it with the
			tech stack you prefer, whether it is
			<span class="bg-sky-300 dark:bg-sky-800">React</span>,
			<span class="bg-yellow-300 dark:bg-yellow-700">Vuejs</span>,
			<span class="bg-amber-300 dark:bg-amber-800">Vanilla js</span>, or even
			<span class="bg-fuchsia-300 dark:bg-fuchsia-800">Webflow</span>. And we plan to add more to this list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, the editor is <span class="bg-cyan-300 dark:bg-cyan-700">just an npm package</span>. This allows you
			to specify exactly which version you want in a project. Upgrade or downgrade just by changing the version in
			your package.json file.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do work in an npm project, you'll very likely work with git. Polygonjs is
			<span class="bg-violet-300 dark:bg-violet-700">designed to work with git</span> just fine, as every file
			saved is either json files or plain javascript. And if you work with typescript, you'll have type definition
			files as well.
